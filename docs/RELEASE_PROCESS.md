# Release Process (maintainers)

Releasing has two separate stages. Creating a GitHub Release does **not**
publish to Google Play — Play submission is a second, manually supervised
step.

## 1. Release PR

Open a PR against `main` that bumps `version:` in `pubspec.yaml`
(e.g. `1.2.3+4`). CI must be green: the `verify` job
(`flutter analyze lib test`, `flutter test`, debug APK build) and the
`history` job (gitleaks scan of the full history). Both are required on
`main`. Merge the PR; do not tag until it lands.

## 2. Tag the release

Tag exactly the pubspec version and push the tag:

```sh
git tag v1.2.3+4 && git push origin v1.2.3+4
```

Only maintainers create release tags. The `Release` workflow refuses a
tag that does not match `pubspec.yaml`.

## 3. CI builds and publishes the GitHub Release

On the tag push, `release.yml` restores signing and Firebase config from
repository secrets (see `docs/RELEASE_SECRETS.md`), re-runs analyze and
tests, builds the signed release AAB and APK with the production
telemetry markers (`OFFICIAL_CONNECT_DISTRIBUTION=production` and the
pubspec `APP_VERSION`, same as
`scripts/android_release_check.sh --build-current`), verifies both with
`scripts/android_release_check.sh --check-artifact`, and publishes a
GitHub Release with both artifacts plus SHA-256 checksums.

To validate without publishing: Actions → Release → Run workflow
(dry run — artifacts land on the workflow run only). A manual run with
`publish` set also creates the Release; it is maintainer-only.

At this point the release exists on GitHub only. No user receives it
until step 4.

## 4. Supervised Play submission and verification

Upload the verified AAB from the GitHub Release to Play as a deliberate,
supervised step — via Play Console, or via the guarded API wrapper in
`docs/PLAY_API_RELEASES.md` (explicit track/rollout, `PLAY_PUBLISH_CONFIRM=YES`).
Prefer internal testing first; stage production with an explicit fraction.

After submission, verify in Play Console: the release, its rollout
state, the pre-launch report, and vitals. Keep the prior production
artifact available for recovery.

## Rollback

Play has no downgrade path: a published version cannot be overwritten
with older artifacts. If a rollout goes wrong:

1. Halt the rollout in Play Console immediately.
2. Remediate with a **new, higher version** (higher version code than
   anything already uploaded) — see the safeguards in
   `docs/PLAY_API_RELEASES.md`. The recovery-bundle procedure in
   `distribution/ANDROID_RELEASE.md` is currently stale (its baseline
   commit is absent from this history); the owner must designate a fresh
   verified baseline before relying on it.
3. Release the fix through this same process (release PR → tag → GitHub
   Release → supervised Play submission).
